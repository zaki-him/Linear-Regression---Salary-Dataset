# Linear Regression on Salary Dataset

This project is a **learning-oriented implementation of Linear Regression** applied to a **Salary dataset from Kaggle**. The main goal is to understand how linear regression works from both a **mathematical** and **programming** perspective, rather than focusing on production-level optimization.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I implemented a simple **Linear Regression model** to predict salary based on experience (or other numerical features provided in the dataset). The project walks through the full machine learning workflow:

* Understanding the dataset
* Data preprocessing
* Implementing linear regression
* Training the model
* Evaluating predictions
* Visualizing results

This project is part of my journey into **Machine Learning fundamentals**.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: Kaggle
* **Dataset**: Salary dataset (e.g. Salary vs Years of Experience)
* **Type**: Supervised learning (Regression)

The dataset contains numerical values that make it ideal for applying basic linear regression techniques.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* What is Linear Regression
* Hypothesis function
* Cost function (Mean Squared Error)
* Gradient Descent
* Model training
* Prediction
* Overfitting vs underfitting (basic intuition)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Python**
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

*(No high-level ML libraries were used unless explicitly stated, to better understand the core logic.)*

## 📈 Results

* The trained model is able to predict salary values based on input features.
* A regression line is plotted to visually compare predictions with actual data.
* The loss decreases over iterations, showing successful learning.

## 📚 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of:

* How linear regression works internally
* How gradient descent updates parameters
* How data affects model performance
* How to structure a basic ML project

This project serves as a **foundation** for more advanced machine learning algorithms.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add feature scaling
* Compare manual implementation with `scikit-learn`
* Add evaluation metrics (R², RMSE)
* Extend to multivariable linear regression
